# What is a Pattern Library?

A pattern library (part of a Style Guide or a Design System), is a way of showing example usage of components and how they're made with HTML, CSS, and other assets.

Having this documented can help siloed teams, or different vendors, coordinate their style to achieve design consistency.

## Q. What is React-Patterns?

A component that autodetects the HTML and CSS of your components, and provides a download cart.

## Q. How can I make patterns for an existing website?

One of the advantages of react-patterns is that it detects the CSS Rules being applied, so you can put your entire site's CSS files on the page and then write HTML that uses them and react-patterns will only display the relevant CSS (no need to manually associate CSS with a particular `<Book>`). This means that it's hopefully a lot less effort to repurpose your existing CSS as a pattern library.

Unlike most Pattern Libaries there's no need to define components in the way that the framework understands. Instead react-patterns works with your existing components and it auto-detects the code being used.

Usage:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Pattern from "react-patterns";
import "h6.css"; // contains h6 { color: red; }

export default () => (
  <main>
    <header>Heading Patterns</header>
    <Pattern>
      <h6>My Heading 6</h6>
    </Pattern>
  </main>
);
```

Will look like

<blockquote><header>Heading Patterns</header><div><h6>My Heading 6</h6><details><summary>HTML</summary>&lt;h6&gt;My Heading 6&lt;/h6&gt;</details><details><summary>CSS</summary>h6 { color: red; }</details></div></blockquote>

## This is a pattern library so where's the dev webserver?

Great question.

`react-patterns` doesn't include a dev server because other projects do it better.

So instead just use <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">Create-React-App</a> or, add `<Pattern>` tags to a new route in your existing app, or use whatever boilerplate you like.

## How does react-patterns organise the page of patterns... with headings, accordions, tabs, or what?

Here's a hypothetical... if your pattern library had 5 components then it probably should be organised quite differently to another library with 1000 components, so this software is intentionally unopinionated about the presentation of your components. react-patterns just tries to do one thing well -- rendering the component preview. Decide for yourself how to organise them (do try <a href="https://github.com/springload/react-accessible-accordion/">[react-accessible-accordion</a> though!).

<p>So, long story short, it doesn't organise them, so design it however you want!</p>

# Code Preview Themes

<p>Use `react-patterns/theme/solarize.css`.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
 <li> [x] Minimal
 <li> [x] React
 <li> [x] CSS Rule Autodetection, so there's no need to manually associate CSS with a component
 <li> [x] ZIP download of particular components
 <li> [x] HTML beautifier
 <li> [x] CSS beautifier
 <li> [x] CSS rule whitelist and blacklist. Pass in 'blacklist' prop with value of 'stylesheet' to string match against attributes of `&lt;link&gt;` or `&lt;style&gt;`, 'stylesheets' to pass in an array of those, or 'rule' to match against selectors, or rules for an array of those.
 <li> [x] CSS Rule whitelist (probably only useful to opt-in specific stylesheets while ignoring others)
 <li> [x] Render prop overrides for HTML and CSS
</ul>

<h3>ToDo</h3>

<ul>
  <li> [ ] ...and show prop types, somehow? (`prop-types` or Flow/TS?). Sadly I'm not sure how we could support FlowType/TypeScript types because those are removed at compile-time.
 <li> [ ] Detect basic JSX React Components... this is almost working
 <li> [ ] Make it support interactive components (eg accumulating CSS across these multiple states).
  <li> [ ] Parse SourceMaps to derive Sass (etc) if possible.
</ul>
